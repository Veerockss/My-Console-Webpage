        <p> To set Visual Studio up, you first need to download the application to your desktop. Create a folder that is called Visual Studio and create another folder inside about what your first project is going to be. Go to Visual Studio and open the folder you created for the project. Start coding!<p>
        <p> The console screen is useful because it let's you see your whole output of what you have coded. To print on the console screen, you have to declare the function console.log. That will print on your console screen. To open the console screen, click on the Go Live function on the bottom right of your screen. If it is not there, close and open Visual Studio again. Now click on the Go Live button and then right click on your webpage. Click on inspect and go to the header that says "console". Seee your output. Finally, the two advantages of having Visual Studio are you have more extensions/libaries and also can build website, web games, and web apps! Start Coding Today! </p>
